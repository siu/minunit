## MinUnit

Minunit is a minimal unit testing framework for C/C++ self-contained in a
single header file.

It provides a way to define and configure test suites and a few handy assertion
types.  It reports the summary of the number of tests run, number of assertions
and time elapsed.

Note that this project is based on:
http://www.jera.com/techinfo/jtns/jtn002.html

## How to use it

This is a minimal test suite written with minunit:

	#include "minunit.h"

	MU_TEST(test_check) {
		mu_check(5 == 7);
	}
	MU_TEST_SUITE(test_suite) {
		MU_RUN_TEST(test_check);
	}

	int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
		MU_RUN_SUITE(test_suite);
		MU_REPORT();
		return 0;
	}

Which will produce the following output:

	F
	test_check failed:
		readme_sample.c:4: 5 == 7


	1 tests, 1 assertions, 1 failures

	Finished in 0.00032524 seconds (real) 0.00017998 seconds (proc)

Check out minunit_example.c to see a complete example. Compile with something
like:

	gcc minunit_example.c -lrt -lm -o minunit_example

Don't forget to add -lrt for the timer and -lm for linking the function fabs
used in mu_assert_double_eq.

## Setup and teardown functions

One can define setup and teardown functions and configure the test suite to run
them by using the macro MU_SUITE_CONFIGURE with within a MU_TEST_SUITE
declaration.

## Assertion types

mu_check(condition): will pass if the condition is evaluated to true, otherwise
it will show the condition as the error message

mu_fail(message): will fail and show the message

mu_assert(condition, message): will pass if the condition is true, otherwise it
will show the failed condition and the message

mu_assert_int_eq(expected, result, message): it will pass if the two numbers are
equal or show their values and the message

mu_assert_double_eq(expected, result, message): it will pass if the two values
are almost equal or show their values and the message. The value of
MINUNIT_EPSILON sets the threshold to determine if the values are close enough.
